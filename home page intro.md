During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK generated several unique research data assets that have enabled critical discoveries and have shaped the COVID-19 response in the UK and around the world. 

The Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP) is a new nationwide partnership to unify these data assets along with human and viral genomes into one trusted research environment (TRE) supported by a high-performance computing space. We aim to promote further vital research into COVID-19[^1] and create the oppertunity for further significant discoveries by creating additional data linkages, automating data flows and analyses, and by democratising access to UK research datasets.
