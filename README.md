This branch contains text files that have been used to make the web copy, each file holds one coherent piece of text but doesn't necessarily represent a whole page on the website on it's own. For example, the home page introduction text is located here as it's own file whereas the home page on the website contains more than just the introduction. Text and files that have not been used on the main site can also be found here for later use. 

This branch is intended as an archive for sources used for the intial text, the draft branch can be edited directly to make changes.
