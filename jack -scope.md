The purpose of the ODAP is to facilitate biomedical research to advance understanding of disease caused by emerging or re-emerging infectious agents, therapy-resistant forms of existing infectious agents or other exposures of public health interest (including poisoning, or exposure to harmful energy sources such as electromagnetic radiation). Research within the ODAP is strictly limited to this purpose.
